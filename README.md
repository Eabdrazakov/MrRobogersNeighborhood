# MrRobogersNeighborhood

<h3>By Ermek Abdrazakov</h3>

<p>This is a web application of Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood. This web application generates a list of values from 0 up to a user-inputted number with unique substitutions. For any number containing 1, 2, or 3, the application replaces it with "Beep!", "Boop!", or "Won't you be my neighbor?" respectively, adding a playful twist to number sequences.
